# Sinkhole Data

Sinkhole event data is generated by our "listen-only" machines, which simply listen and store all data payloads that are sent to them. These payloads will many times refer to what other scanners are probing.

Accessible via:

* Data Stream (Enterprise)
* Web Portal
* API

## Schema

```json
{
   "origin":{
      "ip":"string",
      "port":"int",
      "asn":"int",
      "rdns":"string",
      "rdns_parent":"string",
      "type":"string",
      "client_id":"string",
      "ts":"int"
   },
   "target":{
      "ip":"string",
      "port":"int",
      "protocol":"string"
   },
   "data":{
      "payload":"string",
      "extra":"object",
      "tags":"list"
   }
}
```

### Contents of the fields:

* **origin**: Information about the origin of the payload, i.e, source remote machine that sent the payload
    * **ip**: IP address of the source of the payload
    * **port**: Port of the source of the payload
    * **asn**: AS number associated with the source IP address
    * **rdns**: Reverse DNS of the source IP address
    * **type**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events
    * **client_id**: Static field, always "sinkhole", meant to distinguish from other events
    * **ts**: Timestamp of when the payload was sent

* **target**: Information about the target of the payload, i.e, our machine that received the payload
    * **ip**: IP address of the destination of the payload
    * **port**: Port of the destination of the payload
    * **protocol**: Protocol of the destination of the payload (currently TCP only)

* **data**: Information about the payload
    * **payload**: Raw data that was sent and captured. No additional processing.
    * **extra**: Data extracted after partially processing the payload.
      * **http**: Extra fields related to HTTP payload
         * **headers**: HTTP headers
         * **header_order**: HTTP header order fingerprint string
         * **header_order_hash**: HTTP header order fingerprint hash
         * **method**: HTTP method
         * **path**: HTTP path
         * **version**: HTTP protocol version
      * **ssh**: Extra fields related to SSH payload
         * **description**: SSH identification string
         * **hassh_algorithms**: HASSH algorithms fingerprint string
         * **hassh**: HASSH fingerprint hash
      * **ssl**: Extra fields related to SSL payload
         * **description**: 
         * **ja3**: JA3 fingerprint string
         * **ja3_digest**: JA3 fingerprint hash
    * **tags**: Rule based tagging derived from the payload.
