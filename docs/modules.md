All events generated by our scanning platform, delivered via our Data Streams or API Queries, have the following outline:

* **origin**: 
    * **client_id**:
        * Optional
        * Only on client stream,
        * Your client ID;
    * **job_id**:
        * Optional
        * Only on client stream,
        * Job ID that event is part of;
    * **type**:
        * Event type, module that produced the event,
        * Please refer to the next section for details on each module type;
    * **module**:
        * Either 'portscan' or 'grabber'. Category of the event. Portscan events merely indicate that a port was found open. Grabber events will contain more extracted data such as details of the ip/port/service;
    * **ip**:

    * **port**:
        * Port used by the scanner to perform the analysis. Optional, only some modules will provide this information. Currently only provided by "service-simple". We will be working to add more.
        * Port used by the scanner to perform the analysis;
    * **ts**:
        * Unix Timestamp in Milliseconds;
    * **country**:

## Modules


### [service-simple module](modules/service-simple.md "service-simple")
Our main module for Service Identification. Extract basic product specific information, e.g. product name, version. This module is much faster than "service", since it returns less information.


### [elasticsearch module](modules/elasticsearch.md "elasticsearch") 
Extract Elasticsearch detailed information.


### [http & https module](modules/http.md "http")
Extract HTTP/HTTPS information, e.g. HTTP headers, HTTP status codes, HTTP body, and redirect information. Follows up to 5 redirects.


### [memcached module](modules/memcached.md "memcached")
Extract Memcached detailed information.


### [mongodb module](modules/mongodb.md "mongodb")
Extract MongoDB detailed information.


### [mqtt module](modules/mqtt.md "mqtt")
Grab MQTT information, including messages and topics.


### [rdp module](modules/rdp.md "rdp")
Extract RDP details and screenshot.


### [redis module](modules/redis.md "redis")
Extract Redis detailed information.


### [service module](modules/service.md "service")
Extract detailed product specific information, e.g. product name, version, headers, scripts. If you just want product name and version, consider using the faster "service-simple".


### [ssh module](modules/ssh.md "ssh")
Extract SSH details, e.g. key and algorithms for SSH servers.


### [ssl module](modules/ssl.md "ssl")
